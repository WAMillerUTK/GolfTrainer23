Task: Design and create a one-plane swing trainer to help instruct new golfers to learn
& feel the "one-plane swing"

Implementation: The team has elected to design their own weight distribution sensor by implementing load cell readings with a raspberry pi interface to display the status and tracking of the user's center of gravity in relation to space.
