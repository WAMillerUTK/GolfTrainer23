# UTK Mechanical Engineering Senior Design Project

Task: Design and create a one-plane swing trainer to help instruct new golfers to learn
& feel the "one-plane swing"

Implementation: The team has elected to design their own weight distribution sensor by implementing load cell readings with a raspberry pi interface to display the status and tracking of the client's center of gravity in relation to space. 

The 'User' will be the Pro giving the lesson and is intended to be used as a tool to shed light on undesirable habits in beginner golfers.

The raspberry pi interface runs off the hx711 amplifier and accompanied software for use with the raspberry pi that can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/tatobari/hx711py) or by cloning the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/tatobari/hx711py
```
